						<h2>Volunteering Expereiences</h2>
						<h3>Canley Green Spaces | Oct 2022 - Apr 2023</h3>
						<p>A number of activities are done to preserve the green space nearby Warwick such as Holly tree bashing and environment surveying. A great change to meet lots of interesting people. </p>
						
						<h3>Hospital Volunteering | Jul 2019 - Aug 2019</h3>
						<p>There were a number of volunteering oppourtunities in hospitals to counter a constant lack of staff. Running the rehabilitation medicine shop was a fun experience. We also promoted orgran donation within the hospital since citizens need to opt-in for donation. </p>
						
						<h3>Tutoring Foreign students | Sep 2016 - Jun 2019</h3>
						<p>To help students in different ethnic groups to adjust their life in Hong Kong, I participated in a number of organizations to help students with their homework across all subjects. Getting to meet people from different backgrounds makes it a fun job. </p>
